# Spam Message Classification Project

Welcome to the Spam Message Classification Project, showcasing expertise in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) skills. This project demonstrates the development of an effective spam message classifier, a vital tool for ensuring clean and secure communication channels.

## Project Overview

The Spam Message Classification Project reflects proficiency in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model development. The project addresses the pervasive issue of spam messages in modern communication platforms, creating an accurate and reliable solution for differentiating spam messages from legitimate ones.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Preprocessing**: Applied various techniques, including text tokenization, noise removal, and stopword removal, to clean text data effectively.

- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted essential features from the text data, such as message length and word count, to improve model performance.

- **NLP Techniques**: Utilized the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for NLP techniques like stemming and lemmatization for text data.

- **Machine Learning**: Trained a logistic regression model on the processed text data, achieving impressive results in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and ROC AUC score.

## Prerequisites

To replicate the success of this project, ensure the following prerequisites are installed:

- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook/ Google Colab
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

Conveniently install NLTK using this command:

```bash
!pip install nltk
```

Additionally, download NLTK stopwords and punkt data for accurate text preprocessing:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download("stopwords")



## Installation

To explore the project and witness its capabilities, follow these steps:

Open the Jupyter Notebook `spam_analysis.ipynb` to access the code and execute the spam classification process.

## Usage

The project's Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive guide to using the spam classification model. By executing each cell, experience the following:

- Efficient data preprocessing
- Ingenious feature engineering
- Successful model training and evaluation

Upon completion, a fully trained spam classification model is available.

## Results

The project has produced exceptional results:

- **Accuracy**: 97.97%
- **Recall**: 99.85%
- **Precision**: 97.90%
- **ROC AUC**: 91.73%

These remarkable metrics underscore the project's success in identifying spam messages with precision and reliability.
