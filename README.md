# Spam Message Classification Project

## Description

Welcome to the Spam Message Classification Project, showcasing expertise in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) skills. This project demonstrates the development of an effective spam message classifier, a vital tool for ensuring clean and secure communication channels.

## Project Overview

The Spam Message Classification Project reflects proficiency in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model development. The project addresses the pervasive issue of spam messages in modern communication platforms, creating an accurate and reliable solution for differentiating spam messages from legitimate ones.

## Model Used

In this project, a Logistic Regression model was employed for spam message classification due to its efficiency and effectiveness in handling text data.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

The project demonstrates proficiency in the following key skills:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Various techniques, including text tokenization, noise removal, and stopword removal, were applied to clean text data effectively.

- **Feature Engineering**: Essential features, such as message length and word count, were extracted from the text data to improve model performance.

- **NLP Techniques**: The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) was used for NLP techniques like stemming and lemmatization for text data.

- **Machine Learning**: A logistic regression model was trained on the processed text data, achieving impressive results in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and ROC AUC score.
